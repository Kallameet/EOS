This thesis discusses the different approaches to develop parallel software in Android. At the beginning a short overview provides general information about Android and its developement. Afterwards parallel programming itself will be explained. This part focuses on potential errors, which are unique to parallel software. Next the used integrated development environment will be described and the features used in later chapters of the thesis will be explained. The last two chapters focus on the results of the programs created during this thesis. The first of the two chapters describes different possibilities on how to identify a deadlock in an application. The second chapter provides an overview on the different ways to create parallel software in Android. The different methods will be compared according to performance.

The goal of this thesis is to give an overview on parallel software in Android and to spread awareness to the different dangers and possible errors. Additional solutions to those errors should be shown. In the end an overview on the different ways of parallel applications in Android should be provided as performance comparison.
